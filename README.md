# TSA Software Development 2024-2025
The repository was created by GSMST students for the TSA Software Development submission. Our app, known as GreenHub, assists users with getting jobs in agriculture.

This project was inspired by our AP Environmental Science class, where we were constantly told about the issues with the few people entering agricultural jobs. This issue needs to be brought to life, but it also needs to be fixed more efficiently, and that is where GreenHub was born.
